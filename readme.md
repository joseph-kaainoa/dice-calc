# Simple Dice Calculator

This will parse a dice string, like "1d6+1" and generate a random roll and add the values together.  The result contains all the results of the individual rolls for multiple dice, so you can use to detail exactly how the total was derived.

## Cypress Tests

Added Cypress tests in ./Cypress/integration/.  To use, execute "npx cypress open" in the terminal.
